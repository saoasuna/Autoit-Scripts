# MaplePlay
perform basic functions (ex. trading, training) in Maplestory
<br>
MaplePlay is a collection of scripts that play for you in the online game, Maplestory. They are run in conjunction with a program called Volatile Trainer, which supplies game information to the scripts. For example, Volatile Trainer can save an item's coordinates to a text file, and the scripts can read the information and guide the character to those coordinates using the shortest possible path. This is achieved by converting the map data into a graph and implementing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Other features include training and searching for lowest market prices. Commands are sent using AutoIt.


***Some scripts are not yet included, as I am currently trying to fix them for the recent v.165 path

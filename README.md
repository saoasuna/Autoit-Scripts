perform basic functions (ex. trading, training) in Maplestory
<br>
MaplePlay is a collection of scripts that play for you in the online game, Maplestory. They are run in conjunction with a dll injector called hInjector, which supplies game information to the scripts. For example, hInjector can give the coordinates of an item on the map, and the scripts can be used to guide the character to those coordinates using the shortest possible path. This is achieved by converting the map data into a graph and implementing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Other features include training and searching for lowest market prices. Commands are sent using AutoIt.


***Some scripts are not yet included, as I am currently trying to fix them for the recent v.165 path
